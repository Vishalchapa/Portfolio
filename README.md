Welcome to my first mini-project, where I'll apply HTML5, BootStrap (framework) and CSS, to build a responsive website with a great user experience. 
My portfolio includes a homepage, resume page, contact page, and a CV download link, all designed to work well on both desktop and mobile devices. 
Key features include an interactive resume page with a timeline and skill progress bars, a contact form wired to a JavaScript email API, and a CV download link that opens in a new tab for better user experience. We can preview the finished site here: https://vishalchapa.github.io/Portfolio/.
